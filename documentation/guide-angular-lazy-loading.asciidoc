= Angular Lazy loading

When the development of an application starts, it just contains a small set of features so the app usually loads fast. However, as new features are added, the overall application size grows up  and its loading speed decreases, is in this context where Lazy loading finds its place.
Lazy loading is a design pattern that defers initialization of objects until it is needed so, for example, Users that just access to a website's home page do not need to have other areas loaded.
Angular handles lazy loading through the routing module which redirect to requested pages. Those pages can be loaded at start or on demand. 

== An example with Angular

To explain how lazy loading is implemented using angular, a basic sample app is going to be developed. This app will consist in a window named "level 1" that contains two buttons that redirects to other windows in a "second level". It is a simple example, but useful to understand the relation between angular modules and lazy loading.

.Levels app structure.

This graphic shows that modules acts as gates to access components "inside" them.

Because the objective of this guide is related mainly with logic, the html structure and SCSS styles are less relevant, but the complete code can be found as a sample https://github.com/devonfw/devon4ng/tree/master/samples/AngularLazyLoading[here].


=== Implementation

First write in a console `ng new level-app --routing`, to generate a new project called level-app including an app-routing.module.ts file (*--routing* flag).

In the file app.component.html delete all the content except the router-outlet tag.

.File app.component.html
[source, html]
----
<router-outlet></router-outlet>
----

The next steps consists on creating features modules.

run `ng generate module first --routing`  to generate a module named _first_.

* run `ng generate module first/second-left --routing` to generate a module named _second-left_ under _first_.

* run `ng generate module first/second-right --routing` to generate a module _second-right_ under _first_.

* run `ng generate component first/first` to generate a component named _first_ inside the module _first_.

* run `ng generate component first/second-left/content` to generate a component _content_ inside the module _second-left_.

* run `ng generate component first/second-right/content` to generate a component _content_ inside the module _second-right_.

To move between components we have to configure the routes used:

In *app-routing.module.ts* add a path *'first'* to `FirstComponent` and a redirection from *''* to *'first'*.

.File app-routing.module.ts.
[source, ts]
----
...
import { FirstComponent } from './first/first/first.component';

const routes: Routes = [
  {
    path: 'first',
    component: FirstComponent
  },
  {
    path: '',
    redirectTo: 'first',
    pathMatch: 'full',
  },
];

@NgModule({
  imports: [RouterModule.forRoot(routes)],
  exports: [RouterModule],
})
export class AppRoutingModule {}
----

In *app.module.ts* import the module which includes `FirstComponent`.

.File app.module.ts
[source, ts]
----
....
import { FirstModule } from './first/first.module';

@NgModule({
  ...
  imports: [
    ....
    FirstModule
  ],
  ...
})
export class AppModule { }
----

In *first-routing.module.ts* add routes that direct to the content of `SecondRightModule` and `SecondLeftModule`. The content of both modules have the same name so, in order to avoid conflicts the name of the components are going to be changed using *as* ( original-name as new-name).

.File first-routing.module.ts
[source, ts]
----
...
import { ContentComponent as ContentLeft} from './second-left/content/content.component';
import { ContentComponent as ContentRight} from './second-right/content/content.component';
import { FirstComponent } from './first/first.component';

const routes: Routes = [
  {
    path: '',
    component: FirstComponent
  },
  {
    path: 'first/second-left',
    component: ContentLeft
  },
  {
    path: 'first/second-right',
    component: ContentRight
  }
];

@NgModule({
  imports: [RouterModule.forChild(routes)],
  exports: [RouterModule]
})
export class FirstRoutingModule { }
----

In first.module.ts import `SecondLeftModule` and `SecondRightModule`.

.File first.module.ts
[source, ts]
----
...
import { SecondLeftModule } from './second-left/second-left.module';
import { SecondRightModule } from './second-right/second-right.module';

@NgModule({
  ...
  imports: [
    ...
    SecondLeftModule,
    SecondRightModule,
  ]
})
export class FirstModule { }
----

Using the current configuration, we have a project that loads all the modules in a eager way. Run `ng serve` to see what happens.

First, during the compilation we can see that just a main file is built.

.Compile eager.
image::images/angular/angular-lazy/compile-eager.png["Compile eager", width=800 link="images/angular/angular-lazy/compile-eager.png"]

If we go to http//localhost:4200/first and open developer options (F12 on Chrome), it is found that a document named "first" is loaded.

.First level eager.
image::images/angular/angular-lazy/first-lvl-eager.png["First level eager", width=800 link="images/angular/angular-lazy/first-lvl-eager.png"]

If we click on *[Go to right module]* a second level module opens, but there is no 'second-right' document.

.Second level right eager.
image::images/angular/angular-lazy/second-lvl-right-eager.png["Second level right eager", width=800 link="images/angular/angular-lazy/second-lvl-right-eager.png"]

But, typing the url directly will load 'second-right' but no 'first', even if we click on *[Go back]*

.Second level right eager direct url.

Modifying an angular application to load its modules lazily is easy, you have to change the routing configuration of the desired module (for example `FirstModule`).

.File app-routing.module.ts.
[source, ts]
----
const routes: Routes = [
  {
    path: 'first',
    loadChildren: () => import('./first/first.module').then(m => m.FirstModule),
  },
  {
    path: '',
    redirectTo: 'first',
    pathMatch: 'full',
  },
];

@NgModule({
  imports: [RouterModule.forRoot(routes)],
  exports: [RouterModule],
})
export class AppRoutingModule {}
----

Notice that instead of loading a component, you dynamically import it in a `_loadChildren_` attribute because modules acts as gates to access components "inside" them. Updating the app to load lazily has four consequences:

1. No component attribute.
2. No import of `FirstComponent`.
3. `FirstModule` import has to be removed from the imports array at app.module.ts.
4. Change of context.

If we check *first-routing.module.ts* again, the can see that the path for `ContentLeft` and `ContentRight` is set to 'first/second-left' and 'first/second-right' respectively, so writing 'http//localhost:4200/first/second-left' will redirect us to `ContentLeft`. However, after loading a module with `loadChildren` setting the path to '_second-left_' and '_second-right_' is enough because it acquires the context set by `AppRoutingModule`.

.File first-routing.module.ts
[source, ts]
----
const routes: Routes = [
  {
    path: '',
    component: FirstComponent
  },
  {
    path: 'second-left',
    component: ContentLeft
  },
  {
    path: 'second-right',
    component: ContentRight
  }
];
----

If we go to '_first_' then `FirstModule` is situated in '_/first_' but also its children `ContentLeft` and `ContentRight`, so it is not necessary to write in their path '_first/second-left_' and '_first/second-right_', because that will situate the components on '_first/first/second-left_' and  '_first/first/second-right_'.

.First level lazy wrong path.
image::images/angular/angular-lazy/first-lvl-wrong-path.png["First level wrong path", width=800 link="images/angular/angular-lazy/first-lvl-wrong-path.png"]

When we compile an app with lazy loaded modules, files containing them will be generated

.First level lazy compilation.
image::images/angular/angular-lazy/compile-first-lazy.png["First level lazy compilation", width=800 link="images/angular/angular-lazy/compile-first-lazy.png"]

And if we go to _developer tools -> network_, we can find those modules loaded (if they are needed).

.First level lazy.
image::images/angular/angular-lazy/first-lvl-lazy.png["First level lazy", width=800 link="images/angular/angular-lazy/first-lvl-lazy.png"]

To load the component `ContentComponent` of `SecondLeftModule` lazily, we have to load `SecondLeftModule` as a children of `FirstModule`:

* Change *component* to `*loadChildren*` and reference `SecondLeftModule`.

.File first-routing.module.ts.
[source, ts]
----
const routes: Routes = [
  {
    path: '',
    component: FirstComponent
  },
  {
    path: 'second-left',
    loadChildren: () => import('./second-left/second-left.module').then(m => m.SecondLeftModule),
  },
  {
    path: 'second-right',
    component: ContentRight
  }
];
----

* Remove `SecondLeftModule` at first.component.ts
* Route the components inside `SecondLeftModule`. Without this step nothing would be displayed. 

.File second-left-routing.module.ts.
[source, ts]
----
...
import { ContentComponent } from './content/content.component';

const routes: Routes = [
  {
    path: '',
    component: ContentComponent
  }
];

@NgModule({
  imports: [RouterModule.forChild(routes)],
  exports: [RouterModule]
})
export class SecondLeftRoutingModule { }
----

* run `ng serve` to generate files containing the lazy modules.

== Conclusion

Lazy loading is a pattern useful when new features are added, these features are usually identified as modules which can be loaded only if needed as shown in this document, reducing the time spent loading an application.
