= Angular Clarity Layout

The purpose of this guide is to get a basic understanding of creating layouts Angular Clarity in a devon4ng application. https://clarity.design/[Angular Clarity] is a HTML/CSS framework.


.This is what the finished application will look like
image::images/angular-clarity-layout/1.png[]


== Let's begin

We start with opening the console(in the Devon distribution folder) and running the following command to start a project named AngularZorroLayout.

`devon ng new AngularClarityLayout`

Select `y` when it asks whether it would like to add Angular routing and select `SCSS` when it asks for the stylesheet format. You can also use the devonfw-ide CLI to create a new devon4ng application.

Once the creation process is complete, open your newly created application in Visual Studio Code. Try running the empty application by running the following command in the integrated terminal:

`devon ng serve`

Angular will spin up a server and you can check your application by visiting http://localhost:4200/ in your browser. 

.Blank Application

==  Adding Angular Clarity framework to the project

Next we will add Angular Clarity to our application. In the integrated terminal, press Ctrl + C to terminate the running application and run the following command:

Generate a new Angular application (if you haven't already):
`ng new my-app`
Navigate to the directory:
`cd my-app`
Run the ng add command for Clarity:
`ng add @clr/angular`

After that we can see that the module is imported on app.module.ts

```
import { ClarityModule } from '@clr/angular';
@NgModule({
  declarations: [
    AppComponent
  ],
imports: [
    ClarityModule,
 ],
  providers: [],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent]
})
export class AppModule { }

```


.ClarityModule

== Development

After installed the library we can start to develop the code.

Adding styles in styles.css
```
body {
  margin: 0;
  font-family: "Segoe UI", Roboto, sans-serif;
}
```



First thing that we need to do is the menu
```
<header class="header-6">
  <div class="branding">
    <a href="..." class="nav-link">
      <clr-icon shape="vm-bug"></clr-icon>
      <span class="title">Project Clarity</span>
    </a>
  </div>

  <div class="header-nav">
    <a href="..." class="active nav-link"><span class="nav-text">Dashboard</span></a>
    <a href="..." class="nav-link"><span class="nav-text">Interactive Analytics</span></a>
  </div>
  <div class="header-actions">
      <form class="search">
        <label for="search_input">
          <input id="search_input" type="text" placeholder="Search for keywords...">
        </label>
      </form>
        <clr-dropdown>
          <button class="nav-text" clrDropdownTrigger aria-label="open user profile">
            devonfw@clarityangular
            <clr-icon shape="caret down"></clr-icon>
          </button>
          <clr-dropdown-menu *clrIfOpen clrPosition="bottom-right">
            <a href="..." clrDropdownItem>Settings</a>
            <a href="..." clrDropdownItem>Log out</a>
          </clr-dropdown-menu>
        </clr-dropdown>
<clr-dropdown>
  <button class="nav-icon" clrDropdownTrigger aria-label="toggle settings menu">
    <clr-icon shape="cog"></clr-icon>
    <clr-icon shape="caret down"></clr-icon>
  </button>
  <clr-dropdown-menu *clrIfOpen clrPosition="bottom-right">
    <a href="..." clrDropdownItem>About</a>
    <a href="..." clrDropdownItem>Preferences</a>
  </clr-dropdown-menu>
</clr-dropdown>
  </div>
</header>

```
.Clarity Menu
image::images/angular-clarity-layout/4.png[]

The framework has its own css classes.
For example, the first class that we can see is the `header-6` that one is a css style that change the color from the menu.
Also, we can see it that the framework has some icons where we can choose, where the tag is
`<clr-icon shape”vm-bug></clr-icon>`
The next `div` on the menu will have the navigation header.
As with all this framework we can see that has is own css class `<div class=”header-nav”`
We can see 2 `<a>` tags with a different css class
The first one has the activated class. The difference between both of them shows like this.

.Difference 
image::images/angular-clarity-layout/5.png[]


After seeing this piece of code,  can see that the other part of the menu has another css class.
`<div class=”header-actions”>`
After this all divs inside the last one, they are going to be aligned to the right.

.Search 
image::images/angular-clarity-layout/6.png[]

To do this search bar, just need to create a form with the class `search`
`<form class=”search”>`
To shows the icon we use the tag         `<label for="search_input"></label>`
And the normal input with the 	`id=”search_input”` to match with the previous label

.Dropdown 
image::images/angular-clarity-layout/7.png[]

To do the menu-dropdown , we use the tag owned by the framework called 
`<clr-dropdown>`
```
 <clr-dropdown>
          <button class="nav-text" clrDropdownTrigger aria-label="open user profile">
            devonfw@clarityangular
            <clr-icon shape="caret down"></clr-icon>
          </button>
          <clr-dropdown-menu *clrIfOpen clrPosition="bottom-right">
            <a href="..." clrDropdownItem>Settings</a>
            <a href="..." clrDropdownItem>Log out</a>
          </clr-dropdown-menu>
  </clr-dropdown>
```
.Dropdown 
image::images/angular-clarity-layout/8.png[]

The attribute `clrDropdownTrigger` is needed because if not, we cannot do the tag `<clr-dropdown-menu>` because that tag is going to be activated just if the `clrDropdownTrigger` is activated too.
Also, with the attribute `clrPosition` when can decided where will be positioned the dropdown.

The other part the menu, check the next figure.

.Button  
image::images/angular-clarity-layout/9.png[]

It's pretty much the same code but we just change the attribute `aria-abel` and the icons`

.Button Logic 
image::images/angular-clarity-layout/10.png[]

After we have the whole menu finished, time to see the card.

.Card 
image::images/angular-clarity-layout/11.png[]

In the first figure, all the elements are aligned to the center.
To do this, we just need to use the classes by the framework.
`<div class="clr-main-container">`
The first css class is giving the style to the main container.

`<div class="clr-row clr-justify-content-center">`

This one, is saying that its going to be sorted by rows and all the content inside of this div will be in the center
      `<div class="clr-col-lg-4">`
And the last one it’s the size of the div. This framework has as maximum 12, is like bootstrap.
More examples in: 
https://clarity.design/documentation/grid 

To create the card with his border and all the properties we just call the class
`<div class=”card”>`
To do the tooltip, check next figure.

.Tooltip 
image::images/angular-clarity-layout/12.png[]

We just need to do an <a> tag with this attributes
  `<a href="..." role="tooltip" aria-haspopup="true" class="tooltip tooltip-bottom-right">`
The class is giving us the toltip and his position.
After that we have the:
`<clr-icon shape="info-circle" size="24"></clr-icon>`
That is giving us the icon and the size
And the content of the tooltip is coming from the: 
`<span class="tooltip-content">`
After the tooltip done, we just need to add a image and the text.
To do it we just need to code

```
<div class="card-img">
            <img src="../assets/images/clarity.png">
          </div>
          <div class="card-block">
            <p class="card-text">
              Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard
              dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen
              book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially
              unchanged. It was popularised in the 1930s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more
              recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
            </p>
          </div>
```

For the next card, check next figure

.Card 
image::images/angular-clarity-layout/13.png[]

We are using the same class from the card that we used before.
But to do the numbers on the top we used :
<span class="badge">
And to give some colors we used:
<span class="badge badge-purple"> for example

The next step is do the bars with the progress, to do it we just need to create a div with the class `“progress-block”`
```
        <div class="progress-block">
              <label>Label</label>
                <div class="progress-static">
                  <div class="progress-meter" data-value="25"></div>
                </div>
              </div>
```
To do the bar with that widh and high we ull the class `“progress-static”`
And finally to change the color and the value is with the class “progress-meter” and “progress success”
Depends with class are we using, we will have different attributes to put the value
If we have the progress-static we will use 
`<div class="progress-meter" data-value="43"></div>`
If we have the progress success we need to use:
`<progress value="75" max="100" data-displayval="...%"></progress>`

As you can see, the card has a footer. Check next picture

.Card
image::images/angular-clarity-layout/14.png[]

We just need to add a div with this class inside of the card div
`<div class="card-footer">`
And will link to the card:

`<a class="card-link" (click)="send()">Click to see the modal</a>`
And the method send() its just a method to convert the variable basic to true when is false and false when its true:
```
  basic = false;
  send(): void {
    this.basic = !this.basic;
  }
```
So in the html file we need to write a div with a ngIf, to check if the variable is true and create a model with the tag <clr-modal> and the attribute clrModalOpen and the same name as the variable has.
```
<div *ngIf="basic">
        <clr-modal [(clrModalOpen)]="basic">
```
After this we need to create the body of the modal, to do it we will use a div with the classes from the framework
```
<div class="modal-body">
            <p>But not much to say...</p>
          </div>
          <div class="modal-footer">
            <button type="button" class="btn btn-primary" (click)="basic = true">Ok</button>
            <button type="button" class="btn btn-outline" (click)="basic = false">Cancel</button>          </div>
        </clr-modal>
```
The class to create the body of the modal, it's just to create a div with the class
`<div class="modal-body">`
And to create the footer 
`<div class="modal-footer">`
We can see that the footer has 2 buttons, with different style coming from the framework and with 2 methods with different values
`(click)="basic = true"` on Okk button, this button won't change the variable value so woudnt do anything.
`(click)="basic = false"` on Cancel button. This button will change the value of the variable and will leave the modal.
